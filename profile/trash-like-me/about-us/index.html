            <p class="image-text-aboutus">Trash Like Me is a physical band that embraces dark and painful themes, as
                reflected in their song titles such as Should’ve Offed Myself, Human Failure, and Wasted Flesh. Their
                music likely falls into the realm of extreme genres like deathcore, grindcore, or sludge metal,
                characterized by an intense, bleak, and brutal atmosphere. The EP Should’ve Offed Myself, released in
                2020, stands as one of their key releases, showcasing the band’s signature style filled with rage and
                despair.</p>
            <p class="image-text-aboutus-2">The band is also surrounded by a circle of similarly styled acts like Death
                Is Real, With Death, and Mors Aeterna—highlighting Trash Like Me’s strong following among underground
                extreme music listeners. Their identity is conveyed not only through their sound but also through a raw
                visual aesthetic and a strong DIY spirit, typical of physical bands that move independently and without
                compromise.</p>
