            <p class="image-text-aboutus">Eye of Skadi is a brutal and atmospheric deathcore band hailing from the cold,
                shadowed corners of the underground scene. Formed with the vision of merging raw aggression with
                chilling Norse mythology, the band draws its name from Skadi — the Norse goddess of winter, vengeance,
                and the hunt — symbolizing cold wrath and divine retribution.</p>
            <p class="image-text-aboutus-2">Known for their bone-crushing breakdowns, dissonant riffs, and guttural
                vocals, Eye of Skadi injects a chilling atmosphere into the traditional deathcore framework. Their sound
                often flirts with blackened tones and symphonic textures, creating an intense sonic blizzard that
                mirrors the icy goddess they’re named after. Each song tells tales of frostbitten vengeance, spiritual
                collapse, and mythical war. Their live shows are a cold ritual — filled with dark visuals, raw
                intensity, and a haunting stage presence that makes them stand out in the modern extreme metal scene.
                Whether you're drawn by their punishing sound or the mythic concept behind it, Eye of Skadi offers a
                glimpse into a world where brutality meets ancient frost.</p>
