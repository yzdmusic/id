            <p class="image-text-aboutus">Dorokdox Symphony is a modern melodic metalcore band that fuses heavy riffs,
                emotional hooks, and intense dual vocal dynamics. Drawing clear inspiration from bands like Asking
                Alexandria, they blend soaring clean vocals with raw, aggressive screams to create a sound that is both
                anthemic and ferocious. Their music features tight breakdowns, dynamic tempo shifts, and melodic lead
                lines that cut through thick layers of rhythm guitars. Electronic elements and subtle atmospheric
                textures add a cinematic edge, enhancing the emotional gravity of their songs.</p>
            <p class="image-text-aboutus-2">Lyrically, Dorokdox Symphony explores themes of personal turmoil, betrayal,
                addiction, and inner transformation. Each track feels like a chapter in an ongoing emotional saga â€”
                reflective yet rebellious, painful yet empowering. Their performances are known for high-octane energy
                and dramatic intensity, delivering catharsis through sound. With a passionate fanbase and a growing
                presence in the modern metalcore scene, Dorokdox Symphony continues to evolve while staying true to the
                genre's emotional core.</p>
