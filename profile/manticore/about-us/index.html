            <p class="image-text-aboutus">Manticore is a hardcore band known for its raw intensity, aggressive sound,
                and emotionally charged atmosphere. Their music blends fast, crushing riffs with relentless drum patterns
                and powerful vocals, creating a sonic assault that reflects anger, struggle, and inner conflict. Rooted
                in the hardcore scene, Manticore delivers a sound that is both brutal and expressive, capturing the
                essence of modern hardcore with a dark and uncompromising edge.</p>
            <p class="image-text-aboutus-2">Lyrically, Manticore explores themes such as isolation, emotional pressure,
                resilience, and personal battles, making their songs resonate deeply with listeners who connect to honest
                and confrontational narratives. Through releases like Alone In The Silence and tracks such as Burn It All
                To Death and Nothing Left But Fire, the band has built a strong presence among hardcore fans, standing out
                for their intensity, sincerity, and unwavering dedication to heavy music.</p>
