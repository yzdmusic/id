            <p class="image-text-aboutus">With Death is a relentless force in the modern deathcore scene — a sonic
                embodiment of chaos, pain, and raw human decay. Emerging from the shadows with guttural fury and
                apocalyptic themes, the band combines savage breakdowns, dissonant riffs, and haunting ambient passages
                into a brutal yet immersive listening experience.</p>
            <p class="image-text-aboutus-2">Led by a commanding male vocalist known for his crushing lows and piercing
                high screams, With Death occasionally intertwines the ethereal presence of a female voice — sometimes
                clean, sometimes screamed — adding emotional contrast, eerie atmosphere, and unexpected beauty in the
                midst of devastation. Lyrically, With Death delves into themes of mortality, existential suffering,
                psychological torment, and the collapse of society. Their sound ranges from slow, doom-infused chugs to
                rapid-fire blast beats, layered with ambient textures or eerie samples that make each track feel like a
                descent into madness. The name With Death reflects their identity — not as a band that sings about death
                from afar, but one that walks hand-in-hand with it, embracing its shadow with brutal honesty and
                artistic depth. Live, they are known for their ritualistic stage presence and intense crowd energy,
                turning every performance into a funeral for hope and a celebration of raw emotion.</p>
