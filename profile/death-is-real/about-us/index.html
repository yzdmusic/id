            <p class="image-text-aboutus">Death Is Real is a fictional deathcore band known for their raw, aggressive
                sound and underground garage aesthetic. Blending guttural growls, piercing pig squeals, and crushing
                breakdowns, their music captures the essence of pure chaos and emotional rage. The band’s performances
                often take place in tight, dimly lit rehearsal rooms, with red-orange lighting and walls covered in
                grotesque deathcore posters. One iconic member wears a black bucket on his head, adding mystery and
                theatrical intensity to their live shows.</p>
            <p class="image-text-aboutus-2">Their lyrics explore themes of nihilism, inner torment, and the collapse of
                reality, making every track feel like a descent into madness. Inspired by bands like Whitechapel,
                Carnifex, and early Suicide Silence, Death Is Real delivers a relentless sonic assault that resonates
                with fans of brutal, uncompromising music. Their presence is both intimidating and captivating — a
                perfect storm of sound and fury inside four walls.</p>
